# Load Balancer Solution With Nginx and SSL/TLS

By now you have learned what Load Balancing is used for and have configured an LB solution using Apache, but a DevOps engineer must be a versatile professional and know different alternative solutions for the same problem. That is why, in this project we will configure an [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) Load Balancer solution.

It is also extremely important to ensure that connections to your Web solutions are secure and information is [encrypted in transit](https://security.berkeley.edu/data-encryption-transit-guideline) - we will also cover connection over secured HTTP (HTTPS protocol), its purpose and what is required to implement it.

When data is moving between a client (browser) and a Web Server over the Internet - it passes through multiple network devices and, if the data is not encrypted, it can be relatively easy intercepted by someone who has access to the intermediate equipment. This kind of information security threat is called [Man-In-The-Middle (MIMT) attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack).

This threat is real - users that share sensitive information (bank details, social media access credentials, etc.) via non-secured channels, risk their data to be compromised and used by [cybercriminals](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/cybercriminals).
